üìä **Sorts them automatically** - Puts each paper into the right research category  
üì• **Gives you a clean list** - Download your sorted papers as a spreadsheet or data file  

## Who Should Use This

- **Researchers** organizing their paper collections
- **Librarians** categorizing research databases
- **Students** understanding research fields
- **Grant reviewers** sorting applications
- **Anyone** working with lots of research papers

## Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### What You Need
- A computer with internet
- A free Google account
- Your research paper titles

### Step 1: Get Your Free AI Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account (same as Gmail)
3. Click "Create API key" 
4. Copy the long text that appears (this is your "key")

*Don't worry - this is completely free and takes 30 seconds*

### Step 2: Open the Tool
1. Open the classifier tool in your web browser
2. Look for the sidebar on the left
3. Paste your key where it says "Enter your Google Gemini API Key"
4. You'll see a green checkmark when it's working

### Step 3: Add Your Paper Titles
**For one paper:**
- Type the title in the top box

**For many papers:**
- Use the big text box
- Put each title on its own line
- Press Enter after each title

**Example:**
```
Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis
Gene Editing with CRISPR Technology  
Solar Energy from Algae Biomass
```

### Step 4: Choose What Information You Want
In the sidebar, you can pick extras (all optional):
- ‚úÖ **Confidence score** - How sure the AI is (1-10 scale)
- ‚úÖ **Key terms** - Important words from your title
- ‚úÖ **Related fields** - Similar research areas

### Step 5: Run the Classification
1. Click the blue "üîç Classify Title(s)" button
2. Wait a few seconds (or minutes for many papers)
3. See your results appear on the screen

### Step 6: Download Your Results
Choose your format:
- **CSV file** - Opens in Excel or Google Sheets
- **JSON file** - For more technical uses

6. **Enabling Optimized Bioconversion of Diverse Feedstocks** - Converting waste into useful products
7. **Discovering Fundamentals in Photosynthesis and Beyond** - Studying how plants capture sunlight
8. **Uncovering Molecular Foundations for Predictive Ecology** - Understanding ecosystems with molecules
9. **Building Models to Bridge the Gap Between Lab and Natural Systems** - Computer models of nature
10. **Accelerating Environmental Solutions with Biology** - Using biology to fix environmental problems
11. **Understanding Biological Processes Vital to Health** - Understanding how our bodies work
12. **Addressing Environmental Impacts on People** - How the environment affects our health
13. **Developing Diagnostics, Treatments, and Mitigations for Biopreparedness** - Preparing for biological threats

## Example: What You'll Get

**Your Input:**
```
Machine Learning for Cancer Detection
```

**What You Get Back:**
- **Category:** Advancing Data Science and Computing for Biology
- **Explanation:** This research uses artificial intelligence to help doctors find cancer earlier
- **Confidence:** 9/10
- **Key terms:** machine learning, cancer, detection
- **Related fields:** medical imaging, diagnostics

## Tips for Best Results

‚úÖ **Use clear titles** - "Gene Editing for Cancer" works better than "Novel Approach"  
‚úÖ **Include key words** - Mention your main topic (genes, AI, environment, etc.)  
‚úÖ **Process multiple papers** - The tool is faster when doing many at once  
‚úÖ **Check your results** - The AI is smart but not perfect  

## Common Problems & Solutions

**"API Key Invalid" Error**
- Double-check you copied the entire key from Google
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Try getting a new key if needed

**"No results" or Errors**
- Check your internet connection
- Make sure your titles aren't too short or vague
- Try processing fewer papers at once

**Strange Categories**
- Very technical or unclear titles may get odd results
- Try rephrasing titles to be clearer
- Remember: the AI makes its best guess based on the title alone

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this cost money?**  
A: No! Google gives you free AI usage that's more than enough for most users.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Your titles are sent to Google's AI for processing. Don't use confidential titles.

**Q: How accurate is it?**  
A: Very good for clear, well-written titles. Always double-check important classifications.

**Q: Can I change the categories?**  
A: The 13 categories are built into this version. They cover most biological research.

**Q: What if my paper doesn't fit any category?**  
A: The AI will pick the closest match and usually give a lower confidence score.
