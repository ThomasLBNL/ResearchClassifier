You are an expert research paper classifier. Based ONLY on the research paper title provided, classify the research using the predefined primary strategies below.

PRIMARY STRATEGIES (choose the most appropriate one):

1. Advancing Data Science and Computing for Biology - Develop AI/ML methods and improve data management systems to predict biological functions and enable multimodal data analysis across scales, while ensuring ethical AI standards and data security.
2. Growing Next-generation Omics and Gene-editing Tools - Develop and apply advanced molecular profiling technologies including next-generation sequencing platforms, high-throughput metabolomics pipelines, and precision gene-editing systems. Focus on creating new analytical methods, laboratory techniques, computational frameworks, and bioinformatics workflows for processing multi-omics data to characterize biological systems at unprecedented resolution and scale. This category emphasizes technology development and methodological advancement rather than applying existing genomic techniques to study specific organisms, ecosystems, or ecological questions. It includes creating new tools, workflows, and analytical capabilities, not genome sequencing projects, taxonomic studies, or microbial characterization using standard methods.
3. Developing Hardware to Support and Understand Biology - Create advanced bioreactors, growth chambers, sensors, and imaging systems to measure biological phenomena at relevant scales, including quantum sensing and transportable field systems.
4. Accelerating Experimentation by Integrating Technologies - Build integrated, automated laboratory systems moving toward self-driving labs that seamlessly combine data collection, robotics, and AI to accelerate biological discovery.
5. Developing New, Sustainable, Effective Bioproducts - Identify and engineer biological pathways to create renewable alternatives to petroleum-based materials, including polymers, chemicals, fuels, and coatings with improved properties.
6. Enabling Optimized Bioconversion of Diverse Feedstocks - Design and engineer microbial systems, enzyme pathways, and bioprocessing technologies to convert renewable and waste materials into target products. Emphasize optimization of conversion efficiency, pathway engineering, and bioprocess scale-up for transforming lignocellulosic biomass, organic waste streams, and non-food feedstocks into fuels, chemicals, and materials.
7. Discovering Fundamentals in Photosynthesis and Beyond - Understand and improve natural photosynthetic processes and develop artificial photosynthesis systems to directly convert sunlight into fuels and chemicals.
8. Uncovering Molecular Foundations for Predictive Ecology - Investigate fundamental molecular mechanisms that drive ecological processes and community dynamics in natural environments using molecular techniques to understand biological interactions. Focus on applying genomic, transcriptomic, and other molecular approaches to study species interactions, ecosystem function, environmental responses, and ecological relationships through controlled experimentation and molecular characterization of ecological phenomena. This category includes genome sequencing of environmental organisms, microbial ecology studies, taxonomic characterization, strain isolation, and molecular analysis of ecological communities rather than developing new analytical technologies or computational methods.
9. Building Models to Bridge the Gap Between Lab and Natural Systems - Construct mathematical, computational, and theoretical frameworks that translate mechanistic understanding from controlled laboratory conditions to complex natural environments. Develop multi-scale modeling approaches, parameter estimation methods, and validation strategies that account for environmental variability and system complexity.
10. Accelerating Environmental Solutions with Biology - Apply biological approaches to address environmental challenges like carbon sequestration, ecosystem resilience, and nutrient cycling from bench to field scale.
11. Understanding Biological Processes Vital to Health - Study fundamental human biology to establish health baselines, identify disease biomarkers, and understand genetic variations that affect disease susceptibility and treatment response.
12. Addressing Environmental Impacts on People - Investigate how environmental factors like air pollution, radiation, heat, and chemical exposures affect human health and the human microbiome.
13. Developing Diagnostics, Treatments, and Mitigations for Biopreparedness - Engineer biosensing platforms, therapeutic delivery systems, and countermeasure technologies for detecting and responding to biological threats. Could also be to secure a more stable supply chain for crucial biological products like crops and drugs. Focus on developing portable diagnostic devices, novel antimicrobial strategies, and preventive biotechnologies that can be rapidly deployed for public health protection and biosecurity applications.
